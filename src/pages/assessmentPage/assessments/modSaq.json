Using hardware virtualisation and assured virtualisation products should provide higher confidence in the separation within the computer environment. Additionally, Using virtualisation technologies running on dedicated hardware (a private cloud) or hardware that is shared between a community of users (community cloud) can reduce reliance on the hypervisor to separate your data from that of other customers.\n\nIn Software as a Service offerings, the separation between users is often enforced by software controls running within a single instance of an application.
